Hi 👋 My name is Fred Parker!
=============================

Trainee Data Technician
-----------------------

After making a career change at the end of 2024 - (I was an actor for many years-long story!), I've discovered my passion for data and software development. Efficiency and problem-solving have always driven me, and coding and analytics are a perfect fit for my skills and interests. 

Creativity and adaptability are second nature to me, and I bring those skills in to all of my work. 

Since early 2025 - I've been learning to problem-solve through code and front-end web development (Javascript, HTML) in a brand-new coding bootcamp with the educational coding platform Exercism and I've loved every minute of it! I'm also training as a Data Technician/Analyst with JustIT, working towards a Level 3 Diploma in IT & Data Analysis Skills. I've developed my experience and skills in analysis and data visualisation through PowerBI, Tableau, Azure, and Python. 

My journey is only just beginning, and I'm constantly learning and growing. Check out my repos (coming soon!) for my projects on data-analytics and front-end web development. Feel free to explore my work and connect - I'd love to share my progress with you!
